 
Battery Impedance Analysis and Plotting
This project visualizes the aging of Li-ion batteries through repeated charge/discharge cycles and impedance measurements using Plotly. The data is sourced from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments, which track battery health parameters over time.

Overview
Dataset:
The dataset includes measurements of:
Electrolyte Resistance (Re): Represents the resistance of the electrolyte.
Charge Transfer Resistance (Rct): Indicates the resistance to charge transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface.
Battery Impedance (Re + Rct): Total battery impedance combining both resistances.
Experimental Conditions:
Frequency Sweep: 0.1 Hz to 5 kHz
Operational Profiles: Charge, discharge, and impedance cycles
Stopping Criterion: End-of-life (EOL) of batteries.
Generated Plots
The project creates the following interactive plots:

Electrolyte Resistance (Re) vs Time
Charge Transfer Resistance (Rct) vs Time
Total Battery Impedance (Re + Rct) vs Time
Combined Plot: All parameters over time.
Plots are saved in the plots/ folder as interactive HTML files.
